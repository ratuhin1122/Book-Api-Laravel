# Book API (Read-Only)

This is a simple **Laravel REST API** for managing books.  
This API currently supports **read-only operations**:

- **List all books** (`index`)  
- **Get a single book** (`show`)  

Other operations like `store`, `update`, and `delete` exist in the controller but **require a CSRF token** and are not publicly accessible.
